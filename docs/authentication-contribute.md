# Authentication

## Adding a new authentication provider

The extremely general steps for adding a new authentication method are:
* Fork the repo
* Add an implementation with the same general API as `google_auth.py`
* Submit a pull request

Adding a new auth provider is the hardest part about this package. I'd be more than happy to help out with this, so if you want to add one reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tylerjrichards)
